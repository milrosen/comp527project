# Subject Reduction for Pure Type Systems

COMP 527 (Logic and Computation) project on _Pure Type systems_ by Charlotte Marchal, Dashiell Rich, Milton Rosenbaum, and Zhaoshen Zhai.
- Charlotte Marchal: Study the systems in the lambda-cube and introduce pure type systems in the presentation.
- Dashiell Rich: Understand the proof structure of subject reduction for pure type systems.
- Milton Rosenbaum: Mechanize the proofs in Beluga.
- Zhaoshen Zhai: Prove the Stripping Lemma and write the extended abstract.
